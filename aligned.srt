00:00:13,449 --> 00:00:14,370
Asalaamu alaikum shaykh.

4
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:16,352
My name is Liban.

5
00:00:16,373 --> 00:00:18,215
I'm a student of knowledge at this moment in time.

6
00:00:18,976 --> 00:00:28,148
My question is, what's the best way to explain the concept of Tawheed, which is the oneness of Allah to a person from a non-Muslim background?

7
00:00:29,917 --> 00:00:39,606
 because I have the question that what is the best way of explaining the concept of Tahi to a person who is a non-Muslim background?

8
00:00:39,626 --> 00:00:41,568
First I'd like to know what is his background?

9
00:00:41,588 --> 00:00:42,349
Is he a Christian?

10
00:00:42,689 --> 00:00:43,510
Is he a Hindu?

11
00:00:44,051 --> 00:00:46,233
Is he a Parthi?

12
00:00:46,773 --> 00:00:51,257
So based on the verse of the Quran of Sura Imran Chapter 3 verse 64 which I'll be dealing tomorrow.

13
00:00:52,278 --> 00:00:58,084
Tomorrow my topic is religion in the right perspective talking about the concept of God in the major world religions.

14
00:00:58,267 --> 00:01:10,019
 Allah says, which is the first term.

15
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,288
That we worship them but Allah.

16
00:01:13,268 --> 00:01:16,857
 that we associate to partners with him.

17
00:01:18,501 --> 00:01:22,671
That we erect not among ourselves, Lord and patron other than Allah.

18
00:01:23,853 --> 00:01:28,865
If then they turn back.

19
00:01:29,868 --> 00:01:31,632
So the best is

20
00:01:32,236 --> 00:01:55,189
 If you want to talk about Tauheed, the concept of God, the best surah is surah class, chapter 112, verse number 1 to 4, which says, which says, which says, which says, which says, which says, which says, which says, which says, which says, which says, which says, which says, which says, which says, which says, which says, which says, which says, which says,

21
00:01:55,169 --> 00:02:00,115
 Any person says, so and so candidate is God, you put your candidate to the test of Surya class.

22
00:02:00,636 --> 00:02:03,520
If he passes, we have no objection accepting him as God.

23
00:02:04,321 --> 00:02:06,323
If he fails, we don't accept him.

24
00:02:07,004 --> 00:02:09,748
And if he is a Bible, then you quote from the Bible.

25
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:16,116
If he is a Christian, you quote from the Christian the verses of Tahit which I will do tomorrow.

26
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:22,324
If he is a Hindu, you quote the verses of Tahit from the Vedas, from the Upanishad, from the Bhagavad Gita.

27
00:02:23,384 --> 00:02:27,631
 If he is a Jew, you can quote from the Talmud.

28
00:02:27,651 --> 00:02:31,798
If he is a Parthi, you can quote from the Zell Avesta.

29
00:02:34,864 --> 00:02:39,492
If he is a Sikh, then you quote from Guru Granth Sahib.

30
00:02:39,512 --> 00:02:43,098
And there is another talk I have given, concept of God in the major world religion.

31
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:45,021
So if you see that video,

32
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,411
 And if it's an atheist, then the talk of mind does God exist.

33
00:02:50,053 --> 00:02:50,515
You see that?

34
00:02:51,097 --> 00:02:56,293
And inshallah, it will give you a great deal of knowledge how to deal with an unmuslim.
