13449	14370	Asalaamu alaikum shaykh.
14931	16352	My name is Liban.
16373	18215	I'm a student of knowledge at this moment in time.
18976	28148	My question is, what's the best way to explain the concept of Tawheed, which is the oneness of Allah to a person from a non-Muslim background?
29917	39606	because I have the question that what is the best way of explaining the concept of Tahi to a person who is a non-Muslim background?
39626	41568	First I'd like to know what is his background?
41588	42349	Is he a Christian?
42689	43510	Is he a Hindu?
44051	46233	Is he a Parthi?
46773	51257	So based on the verse of the Quran of Sura Imran Chapter 3 verse 64 which I'll be dealing tomorrow.
52278	58084	Tomorrow my topic is religion in the right perspective talking about the concept of God in the major world religions.
58267	70019	Allah says, which is the first term.
70200	73288	That we worship them but Allah.
73268	76857	that we associate to partners with him.
78501	82671	That we erect not among ourselves, Lord and patron other than Allah.
83853	88865	If then they turn back.
89868	91632	So the best is
92236	115189	If you want to talk about Tauheed, the concept of God, the best surah is surah class, chapter 112, verse number 1 to 4, which says, which says, which says, which says, which says, which says, which says, which says, which says, which says, which says, which says, which says, which says, which says, which says, which says, which says, which says, which says,
115169	120115	Any person says, so and so candidate is God, you put your candidate to the test of Surya class.
120636	123520	If he passes, we have no objection accepting him as God.
124321	126323	If he fails, we don't accept him.
127004	129748	And if he is a Bible, then you quote from the Bible.
131210	136116	If he is a Christian, you quote from the Christian the verses of Tahit which I will do tomorrow.
136136	142324	If he is a Hindu, you quote the verses of Tahit from the Vedas, from the Upanishad, from the Bhagavad Gita.
143384	147631	If he is a Jew, you can quote from the Talmud.
147651	151798	If he is a Parthi, you can quote from the Zell Avesta.
154864	159492	If he is a Sikh, then you quote from Guru Granth Sahib.
159512	163098	And there is another talk I have given, concept of God in the major world religion.
163579	165021	So if you see that video,
165760	169411	And if it's an atheist, then the talk of mind does God exist.
170053	170515	You see that?
171097	176293	And inshallah, it will give you a great deal of knowledge how to deal with an unmuslim.
